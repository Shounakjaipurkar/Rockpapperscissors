# Rockpapperscissors
This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game built using Python. The user plays against the computer by entering a number (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, 3 for Scissors). The computer randomly selects its move, and the program determines the winner based on traditional game rules. The game continues in a loop until the user decides to exit by entering 0.

## What It Does:
- You choose your move by entering 1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, or 3 for Scissors.
- The system randomly selects its move.
- The game compares both choices and prints the result: Win, Loss, or Draw.
- The game keeps running until you enter `0` to exit.

## Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- random module (for system's choice)

## How to Run It:
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Save the code in a file, e.g., `rock_paper_scissors.py`.
